# wheel_and_meal

Wheel and Meal is an innovative mobile application designed to offer a seamless and integrated service where users can book bike rides and order groceries and food. This app also provides an opportunity for users to sign up as "pilots" who can take up two-wheeler delivery and ride orders. The app aims to address the common issue of ride requests being declined in remote areas, especially during late hours, by allowing pilots to supplement their income with food and grocery deliveries.
